## Purpose

The main goal of the `gtrlib.largetrees` package is to offer
additional database fields and formats for the `genealogytree`
package, particularly for typesetting large trees.
This package is the side product of typesetting an actual genealogy tree
with almost 400 persons on 16 levels and on a DIN-A0 poster.
